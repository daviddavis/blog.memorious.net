For all of you Ikeaphobics, there's a new novel out there for you. It's called
*Horrorstör* and it's written by
[/r/horrorlit](http://reddit.com/r/horrorlit)'s own [Grady
Hendrix](http://www.gradyhendrix.com/). Here is the marketing text:

> Something strange is happening at the Orsk furniture superstore in Cleveland,
> Ohio. Every morning, employees arrive to find broken Kjerring wardrobes,
> shattered Brooka glassware, and vandalized Liripip sofa beds—clearly, someone
> or something is up to no good. To unravel the mystery, five young employees
> volunteer for a long dusk-till-dawn shift—and they encounter horrors that
> defy imagination. Along the way, author Grady Hendrix infuses sly social
> commentary on the nature of work in the new twenty-first century economy.

> A traditional haunted house story in a contemporary setting (and full of
> current fears), *Horrorstör* comes conveniently packaged in the form of a
> retail catalog, complete with illustrations of ready-to-assemble furniture
> and other, more sinister accessories. We promise you’ve never seen anything
> quite like it!

So, yea, if you have any nightmares about putting together cheap Scandinavian
furniture, this is for you.
