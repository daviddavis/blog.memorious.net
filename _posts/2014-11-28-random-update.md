As you probably can tell, I haven't blogged in quite a long time. There's a
very good reason for this though: I've become the managing editor of <a
href="http://weirdfictionreview.com">Weird Fiction Review</a>. I've put all of
my efforts to writing, editing, and organizing that site. I highly recommend
checking it out if the stuff on my blog is your cup of tea. It has a lot of
great articles and stories from weird fiction and related subgenres. Anyway,
this blog is pretty much deprecated (for now).
