categories: reading scifi fiction literature books

I lent one of my friends *The Time Traveler's Almanac* and he asked for some
recommendations as to what to read. Well, I recommend all of the stories
really. But here's a summary of what I liked about some of the ones that stood
out to me.

* **The Traveler's Rest** - one of the most unique and endearing stories to me. A must-read for all.
* **The Fire Watch** - if you like WWII and scifi, read this.
* **Enoch Soames** - this tale is 100 years old. If you like older fiction, check it out. One of my favorites.
* **The Threads of Time** - very interesting scifi story.
* **Hwangâ€™s Billion Brilliant Daughters** - a very original story. Definitely worth reading.
* **Young Zaphod Plays It Safe** - a classic.
* **The Weed of Time** - one of my favs.
* **Another Story** - another classic.
* **Life Trap** - dark but short.
* **A Sound of Thunder** - a classic and enjoyable story.
* **In The Tube** - another old tale. Very sad.
