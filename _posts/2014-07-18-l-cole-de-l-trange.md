Ever since discovering Jean Ray in 2012 anthology *The Weird* I've found myself
enchanted with the Belgium branch of [weird
fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weird_fiction). However, despite weird
fiction's cultish popularity in America, very few of the French language weird
fiction works have been translated into English. [Weird Fiction
Review](http://weirdfictionreview.com) however has at times featured
outstanding stories from [Marcel
Schwob](http://weirdfictionreview.com/by/marcel-schwob/), [Jean
Muno](http://weirdfictionreview.com/by/jean-muno/), and [Jean
Ray](http://weirdfictionreview.com/by/jean-ray/). However, in terms of books
that are available in print, there remain only a few. This is a list of books
originally in French that have been translated into English and remain
available today.

![The Book of Monelle](/public/img/posts/book_of_monelle.png =230x)
##*The Book of Monelle* by Marcel Schwob
Marcel Schwob was a French symbolist who influenced a lot of well known writers
such as Jorge Luis Borges. *The Book of Monelle* combines nihilism and
suffering with haunting folkloric tales. It is available from [Wakefield
Press](http://wakefieldpress.com/) who is also publishing Marcel's *The King in
the Golden Mask* in 2015. Both works are translated by Kit Schuler. Be sure to
check out [his interview with the Paris
Review](http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/tag/kit-schluter/) and also check
out ["The Plague" by Marcel Schwob on Weird Fiction Review for a haunting
tale](http://weirdfictionreview.com/2014/06/the-plague/).

![The Conductor and Other Tales](/public/img/posts/the_conductor.jpg)
##*The Conductor and Other Tales* by Jean Ferry
Edward Gauvin is a name you'll probably hear a lot if you read French fantastic
and weird literature. He's a translator of a variety of French works and he's
also a contributor to the Weird Fiction Review website. In *The Conductor and
Other Tales*, Gauvin has collected some of the best nightmarish
[pataphysical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pataphysical) tales of Jean Ferry.
In addition to this work, be sure to check out [Ferry's "Society Tiger" on
Weird Fiction Review](http://weirdfictionreview.com/2013/04/the-society-tiger/).

![House of Oracles](/public/img/posts/house_of_oracles.jpg)
##*The House of Oracles* by Thomas Owen
*House of Oracles* is printed by one of my favorite publishers at the moment,
[Tartarus Press](http://tartaruspress.com/). It's translated by Iain White who
has also translated Marcel Schwob. Thomas Owen isn't as well known as his
mentor, Belgian weird author Jean Ray, but he's every bit as good if not better
in some ways. Owen became acquainted with Ray and remained close friend with Ray
until Ray's death in 1964. His works are much like Ray's but feel a bit more
contemporary.

![The Other Side of the Mountain](/public/img/posts/other_side_of_the_mountain.jpg =230x)
##*The Other Side of the Mountain* by Michel Bernanos
If you've read the Southern Reach Trilogy by [Jeff
VanderMeer](http://www.jeffvandermeer.com/) and enjoyed some
of the weird elements of the story, you should check this out. VanderMeer has
[cited it as one of the influences on his trilogy](http://www.bookish.com/articles/jeff-vandermeer-power-of-nature-inspired-new-sci-fi-novel-annihilation-).
This book was reprinted in 2007 by Cherokee Publishing Company but it's also
available in *The Weird* anthology by Ann and Jeff VanderMeer (see below).

![A Life on Paper](/public/img/posts/life_on_paper.jpg)
##*A Life on Paper: Stories* by Georges-Olivier Châteaureynaud
Another work translated by Edward Gauvin and this time offered by [Small Beer
Press](http://smallbeerpress.com/). While this work is perhaps more fantastic
then it is weird, it's also more contemporary than some of the other works on
this list. Châteaureynaud's stories are said to be reminiscent of Kafka and
Borges.

![Jean Muno](/public/img/posts/jean_muno.jpg =220x)
##*Glove of Passion, Voice of Blood* by Jean Muno
While the Golden Age of Belgium weird included authors Jean Ray and Thomas Owen,
[it has been said, Jean Muno belongs to the Silver Age](http://weirdfictionreview.com/2014/01/jean-munos-unusual-tales/).
Jean Muno is perhaps best known for the surrealism in his works. This work is
from Owl Creek Press and it includes two of Muno's better known stories, "Glove
of Passion" and "Voice of Blood," along with a couple other stories. The
stories in this work demonstrate Muno's ability to find horror in the common,
everyday life. While technically out of print, it can be had for around $10 on
the used market.

![The Weird](/public/img/posts/the_weird.jpeg =250x)
##*The Weird* edited by Ann and Jeff VanderMeer
*The Weird* is an absolutely fantastic and definitive collection of weird
fiction stories that is a must for any fan of the genre. However, for the
purposes of this list, it's an essential must-have as it includes two amazing
stories by Jean Ray along with the complete novella "Other Side of the
Mountain" (see above). The Jean Ray stories, "The Shadowy Street" and "The
Mainz Psalter," are top-notch translations and among his best stories. I'd
recommend the anthology not only for any weird fiction fan but for anyone that
has a passing interest in weird fiction or international dark literature.

![Tales of Mystery and Horror](/public/img/posts/tales_of_mystery_and_horror.jpg)
##*Tales of Mystery and Horror* by Maurice Level
Level was printed in early 20th century Parisian newspapers and known for his
macabre fiction. He was a contemporary of H.P. Lovecraft. This work features
26 of Level's stories and there's also [a book from Centipede Press that
features this collection plus two of Level's novels](http://www.centipedepress.com/horror/mauricelevel.html).

![Malpertuis](/public/img/posts/malpertuis.jpg)
##*Malpertuis* by Jean Ray
Jean Ray is probably one of the most famous if not *the* most famous Belgian
weird author. He's also considered one of the founders of the Belgian strange.
All of Ray's English translations remain out of print. However, unlike many of
Ray's other books, it remains very easy to obtain. A used copy of this work
will only set you back $10-15. It's worth noting though that this is a novella
and not a collection of stories (unlike many of Ray's other books such as
*Ghouls in my Grave* which can sometimes be found on ebay for less than $50).
This work is also translated by Iain White.
