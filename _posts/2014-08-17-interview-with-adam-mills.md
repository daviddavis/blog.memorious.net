When I recently heard that Adam Mills was stepping down as managing editor of
WFR, I knew I had to get an interview with him. Adam has had an amazing run
as editor of WFR. Just like the [interview with Gauvin]({% post_url 2014-08-04-interview-with-edward-gauvin %}),
I collected questions again over at our [WeirdLit
community](http://www.reddit.com/r/WeirdLit) (thanks guys!) and send them over
to Adam.  Reading through his interview, I knew this was another fantastic
piece. Adam gives an incredible and insightful look at weird fiction, and I
was rather amazed at how much new stuff there was that I had not heard of even
though I thought I was pretty well versed in weird. For example, did you know
M. John Harrison also wrote a story titled "The Great God Pan," which he then
later turned into a novel called _The Course of the Heart_?

**Our standard first question: do you have any projects you'd like to promote?
Anything upcoming or recently released that we might be interested in?**

None at the moment. I haven't had a lot of writing published recently, due to
focusing on editorial work and school. My most recent story, "The Artist in the
Tower," was [published over at _Ideomancer_ back in
2012](http://www.ideomancer.com/?p=2253). I'd just love for people to continue
to visit and support WFR, really.

**Can you tell us about what it was like to edit WFR? How did you find pieces
or come up with ideas for articles?**

Editing WFR was definitely a learning experience. It was really more of a
year-round project than anything, and to be honest any kind of publication or
website is like that. There was always lots of reading more than anything.
Since we don't really solicit or accept original submissions by and large, much
of my duties involved sifting through already-published material to find cool
stories and essays that may have somehow slipped past people's notice.
Sometimes Jeff and Ann VanderMeer, as editors-in-chief, would send me materials
to read and consider from, which helped me organize my reading and evaluation
process quite a bit. I didn't come up with ideas for articles so much as
overarching themes for the site, like our King in Yellow theme a few months
ago, for instance.

For the most part, my largest duties were split between reading material for
republication and editing articles submitted by our regular contributors, who
always made my job incredibly easy! Sometimes I would give advice concerning
overall directions for pieces or topics for consideration, but by and large I
concentrated on making sure my contributors made their arguments or analysis in
the clearest, most interesting way possible. And, frequently, I didn't have to
do much. Like I said, they made my job easy.

**What were some of your favorite pieces from WFR?**

So many to choose from! The installments we reprinted from John Clute's _The
Darkening Garden_ stand out to me, just because physical copies of that book
are so difficult to come by, and to my knowledge _TDG_ hasn't been reprinted
yet (though it will be soon in his upcoming book _Stay_). I greatly admire
_TDG_ as a potential critical text for dark fiction, including weird fiction,
so I was happy to be involved in featuring parts of it online. I was also
really proud of our King in Yellow week, where we featured classic stories from
that particular mythos by Robert Chambers and Ambrose Bierce alongside a modern
mythos story from Joe S. Pulver, Sr. Our serialization of Michael Cisco's _The
Divinity Student_ was a particular favorite feature as well. Perhaps above all,
I loved all of the rare weird fiction in translation we were able to acquire,
from authors such as Jehanne Jean-Charles, Bernard Quiriny, and Olympe
Bhely-Quenum.

I'm also intensely proud of the essays we published as part of the 101 Weird
Writers series. They're all so fantastic. The roster of contributors we pulled
together to write about these authors and stories are some of the most
talented, intelligent scholars and writers I've ever had the pleasure to work
with. The same goes for the regular work of our columnists – Matthew Pridham,
Nancy Hightower, Maureen Kincaid Speller, and Katie Lavers – and their
articles. I always got the feeling while reading their articles that I wasn't
their boss or editor so much as someone simply kicking back and enjoying their
work.

**Were there any stories or articles that you wanted to publish on WFR but
weren't able to?**

There were a few. Thankfully, much of the time I got what I wanted. I remember
one particular instance, though, with a Marly Youmans story called
"Prolegomenon to the Adventures of Childe Phoenix" that I really wanted for the
site after I first read it. It's so emotionally resonant and bizarre; the story
has this eerie sense of emotional algebra and allegory to it, but it's tricky
to unwind, even as it sticks in your mind. Unfortunately, shortly after I came
to this decision the story was reprinted by John Joseph Adams at _Lightspeed_.
Thankfully, there was another story of Youmans's that I wanted to reprint, "An
Incident at Agate Beach," which worked great for the site.

**As editor for WFR, did you get any indication that Weird Fiction might be
growing?**

Oh, absolutely. It's really cool and a little odd even to see how broad the
discussion of weird fiction as a force of literature is now in popular
discourse. The most obvious cue came earlier this year, probably, with _True
Detective_ and its evocation of the mythos of the King in Yellow, and also of
the pessimistic philosophy used for dark revelatory purposes in the writing of
Ligotti and Lovecraft, for instance.

Before all that, though, I remember seeing the response to the VanderMeers'
anthology (_The Weird_) and how it brought a lot of readers and writers
interested in this sort of thing out of the woodwork, or made them realize they
had been working toward this sort of thing all along. I also like how it gave a
lot of otherwise under-read authors something to point toward and say,
"_That's_ what I'm working on." Seeing all these people declare allegiance to
this kind of literature has been wonderful, and quite often they did so on
WFR's website or FB page, or the like.

As an academic, I've also seen a greater interest in the analysis and
discussion of weird fiction. Academics are now getting around to discussing
Lovecraft and his work more, which amuses me to no end because it feels like we
in the community have been talking about him forever already.

**What are the books that really got you interested in the genre? What are the
seminal texts you would use to introduce someone to weird?**

My gateway to weird fiction came mainly through horror, and specifically
through Stephen King, Clive Barker, and H.P. Lovecraft in middle and high
school. Later on in college, I was enraptured by writers like Jorge Luis
Borges, Philip K. Dick, and Harlan Ellison. On top of that, Ray Bradbury has
entranced me all my life. So, before I even knew what weird fiction was, or
that it was or could be a specific "thing," I appreciated and looked up to a
lot of the writers vital to the movement.

The tricky thing about introducing someone to weird fiction is deciding what
key features of the literature you want to expose them to right off the bat.
Some people get into weird fiction for the creature feature aspect, and some
get into it for the sense of what John Clute calls _vastation_ in _The
Darkening Garden_: a sense of dark revelation or vision where the artifice of
the world is stripped away and you are left with an honest, terrifying glimpse
at the reality beneath. There's also something to be said for the use of
displacement as an affect in weird fiction; the reader/narrator/protagonist
finds himself or herself transgressing, often unawares, into inexplicable
territory that they do not know, and which terrifies or unnerves them as well.

So, when creating an introductory reading list for weird fiction, I prioritize
these four elements: 1) strange biology/anatomy/zoology that cannot be
explained or understood through realistic terms; 2) dark revelation of a world
beyond or underneath our world, or aspects of our world we are ignorant of; 3)
transgression of territories of existence, which can range from the explicitly
fantastical or horrific to the absurd; and 4) an intensity and strangeness of
perspective on a character's part, which can make everything else in the story
feel weird.

Considering all of that, here is my crack at a good introductory list:

- "The Willows" by Algernon Blackwood
- "The Call of Cthulhu" by H.P. Lovecraft
- "The Book" by Margaret Irwin
- _The Metamorphosis_ by Franz Kafka
- "The Mainz Psalter" by Jean Ray
- _The October Country_ by Ray Bradbury
- "White Rabbits" by Leonora Carrington
- _Ficciones_ by Jorge Luis Borges
- _The Palm-Wine Drinkard_ by Amos Tutuola
- "It's a _Good_ Life" by Jerome Bixby
- "The Other Side of the Mountain" by Michel Bernanos
- "The Little Dirty Girl" by Joanna Russ
- "Faith of Our Fathers" and _Ubik_ by Philip K. Dick
- "I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream" and "The Deathbird" by Harlan Ellison
- "Bloodchild" by Octavia Butler
- "The Swords" and "The Hospice" by Robert Aickman
- "The Great God Pan" by M. John Harrison
- "The Lawnmower Man" and "The Man in the Black Suit" by Stephen King
- "In the Hills, the Cities" and most of _Books of Blood_ by Clive Barker
- "The Boy in the Tree" by Elizabeth Hand
- "The Night Whiskey" by Jeffrey Ford
- "Singing My Sister Down" by Margo Lanagan
- The Ambergis Trilogy and the Southern Reach Trilogy by Jeff VanderMeer
- _The Divinity Student_ by Michael Cisco
- _Perdido Street Station_ by China Mieville
- _Stranger Things Happen_ by Kelly Link
- _Teatro Grottesco_ by Thomas Ligotti
- _We Have Always Lived in the Castle_ by Shirley Jackson
- _The Ape's Wife and Other Stories_ by Caitlin R. Kiernan

I'd have people move down the list in that order, more or less. At that point,
they can dive into the rest of weird fiction and the work of the respective
authors (and more, so much more), as much truly great stuff as there is to read
even beyond this selection. I picked mainly short stories because the best
weird fiction tends to be short or novella-length at most. Novel-length weird
fiction is much harder to come by, primarily because the effects of weird
fiction work so well at short lengths.

**Are there any stories/authors you think are under-appreciated that we should check out?**

If you haven't read any of Helen Marshall's work yet, you really should. We
reprinted one of her stories from _Hair Side, Flesh Side_ for WFR back in 2013,
and quite honestly it was hard to pick just _one_ story. Beyond that, though, I
think more readers need to seek out literature in translation in weird fiction,
like the work of Leena Krohn. There's also a lot of material from earlier on in
the development of weird fiction, like Alfred Kubin's _The Other Side_ or the
work of Gustav Meyrink, which gets overshadowed by discussion of
already-acknowledged weird fiction greats.

**What's something you always to see tried in weird fiction, but have never yet encountered?**

I'd love to see a choose-your-own-adventure weird fiction story! I've been
obsessed with CYOA for a long time, and I'd love to see a CYOA that weds that
particular story structure to the darkest, most visionary and earth-shaking
kind of approach. Imagine how freaky it would be to have weird visions like
those in Laird Barron's "The Forest" encountered through second person – or to
realize that you yourself actually chose to see these things, in the long run.

Actually, scratch what I said: I'll probably try and take a crack at that
project myself, sometime later. That'd be fun to write.

**What other kinds of writing do you enjoy, apart from weird fiction?**

I enjoy a lot of what falls under the umbrella of speculative fiction. I
started out writing horror, so I'm always going to enjoy that. I'm not a big
epic fantasy or urban fantasy guy in general, though I was really into epic
fantasy as a kid. I love contemporary fantasy and magic realism, and surrealism
as well. I love experimental and cross-genre writing in general. I was really
into slipstream when it started getting batted about as the new label for
cross-genre speculative writing, and I still enjoy most of the literature that
was associated with that label. One day I want to have read everything (or
attempted to, anyway) mentioned in [Bruce Sterling's slipstream essay from
_CATSCAN_
5](https://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/Bruce_Sterling/Catscan_columns/catscan.05).
I fondly love a lot of the science fiction and fantasy produced during the new
wave movement of the 60s and 70s as well. I guess you could say I most enjoy
stories that don't fit within easily definable categories, or stories that are
more concerned with producing strange effects within the reader than stories
that are compelled to have all the tropes of a particular genre.

I read realistic fiction sometimes too. I love stories that are tied to
specific historical moments or periods and involve some kind of societal
scrutiny or interrogation. I want to feel like there is more at stake with the
telling of a story than just the feelings of the author; if I catch even a
whiff of navel-gazing, it turns me off. I enjoy writers like Aimee Bender,
Karen Russell, Denis Johnson, and Tim O'Brien on the literary side of things.
That said, I'm not a fan of making divisions between literary and genre as
opposing factions of literature. To me, _literary_ is a notation of quality
while _genre_ is a notation of detail and trope. I also enjoy seeing writers
like Bender and Russell being held in such value by the literary establishment
while writing stories that, to me, seem quite fantastical.
