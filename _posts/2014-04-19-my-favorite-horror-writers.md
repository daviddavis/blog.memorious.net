![Ambrose Bierce](/public/img/posts/bierce.jpg)

Stephen King's *Carrie* recently celebrated its 40th anniversary. I've read
King but have never been able to like his writing very much. I've always felt
though that he's had a sort of economy of words that fits well within the
contemporary realm of mainstream fiction. His plots have a lot of action and
out-right horror but very little description, subtly, and mood building.

So I wanted to compile some of my favorite horror authors that I feel like are
the antithesis of King. King has had a huge influence on horror and so many of
these authors are pre-1970's. Without further ado, here they are.

* M\. R\. James - a classic. You can get all his ghost stories at Project Gutenberg.
* E\. F\. Benson - an author I just recently discovered.
* Algernon Blackwood - I've really enjoyed his short story, "The Willows" (it's
probably my favorite work of horror) but have never been able to get into his
other stories.
* Sheridan Le Fanu - probably best known for his work "Carmilla" but I like his
other works better like "Schalken the Painter" and "Green Tea".
* H P Lovecraft - another well known author I used to love a lot but in the past few years, I've grown to like other authors like Blackwood better.
* Ambrose Bierce - somewhat fits the bill although his stories are usually short and concise. I've liked such stories as his "An Inhabitant of Carcosa" and "The Damned Thing."
* Robert W. Chambers - speaking of Carcosa, I've loved Chambers' *King in Yellow* collection.
* Arthur Machen - one of my absolute favorites. His *Three Impostors* book is amazing (be sure to checkout "White People", "Novel of the Black Seal", "). I also love *The Great God Pan*.
* T\. E\. D\. Klein - a more contemporary writer who hit a home run with *Dark Gods*.
* William Hope Hodgson - one of my favorites. "House on the Borderlands" is a terrifying tale.
* Jean Ray - perhaps not as well known as these other authors and perhaps not even a horror writer (but a weird fiction writer). I've loved his writing ever since discovering him in *The Weird*.
