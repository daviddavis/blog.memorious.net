I just got Centipede's recent newsletter and one of their new titles really
stood out. In July, Centipede Press will be releasing a new anthology of
Lovecraftian tales by S.T. Joshi called *A Mountain Walks: Great Tales of the
Cthulhu*. The artwork and authors that are lined up for it look amazing.

From Joshi's blog:

> It contains a whopping 29 stories (10 of them original), along with
> spectacular art portfolios by Erlend MÃ¸rk, Allen Koszowski, and Stanley C.
> Sargent, along with much other work.

Some of the authors include Joseph S. Pulver, Sr., Donald Tyson, Cody
Goodfellow, Caitlin Kiernan, Laird Barron, Michael Shea, Patrick McGrath, Mark
Samuels, and Gemma Files. Also the book contains new artwork by David Ho, John
Kenn Mortensen, and Thomas Ott.

The book is oversized at 11 x 7 inches and contains 692 pages. Joshi hints on
his blog that the price may be around $125 but is not totally sure. Centipede
also says they'll have the book on sale for the first couple weeks and they
expect to have 500 copies sometime in mid to late July.

Perhaps the most amazing part of the book though is the signatures. From
Centipede's newsletter:

> Each copy is signed by Thomas Ligotti, T.E.D. Klein, Laird Barron, Caitlin
> Kiernan, and many others. The signature pages are signed by 25 people and
> [we] went halfway around the world for signatures

I'm definitely excited about the Klein and Ligotti signatures. You never see
them at conferences so usually the only way you can their signatures is via
limited edition books.

This will definitely be a must-have for fans of weird fiction. And given the
amount of content, signature, etc, I think the price is not too bad.

**UPDATE**: Just got the table of contents in this week's Centipede Newsletter.
Also, [it's available for preorder this week for
$125](http://www.centipedepress.com/anthologies/mountainwalked.html).
