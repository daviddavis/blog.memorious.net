[Dark Renaissance](http://darkrenaissance.com/) has a two book series edited by
the venerable [S.T. Joshi](http://stjoshi.org/) featuring Lovecraft's favorite
horror stories. The first book is called [*The Ghost of Fear and
Others*](http://darkrenaissance.com/product/the-ghost-of-fear-and-others-h-p-lovecrafts-favorite-horror-stories-edited-by-s-t-joshi)
and it's out now. It looks like the unsigned editions are still in print but
the signed copies are sold out. It has a lot of great early weird/horror
writers like Lord Dunsany, E. F. Benson, Rudyard Kipling, and H. G. Wells. Even
some lesser known ones too like my personal favorite, Fitz-James O'Brien.
Here's a blurb from the publisher's website:

> H\. P\. Lovecraft was a voracious reader of supernatural and fantastic fiction, and he was continually on the hunt for powerful and stimulating works in these genres. Many of the stories he read directly influenced his own writings. This first volume of H. P. Lovecraft’s Favorite Horror Stories presents 16 stories that Lovecraft found to be of particular merit. Among them are the beautiful poetic fantasy “Idle Days on the Yann” by Lord Dunsany; Fiona Macleod’s grimly evocative “The Sin-Eater,” which influenced “The Rats in the Walls”; Arthur Machen’s grisly novelette “Novel of the White Powder,” which Lovecraft adapted for “Cool Air”; and M. P. Shiel’s “The House of Sounds,” which Lovecraft ranked among the greatest weird tales ever written. Also included are hard-to-find stories by Nathaniel Hawthorne, E. F. Benson, Théophile Gautier, John Buchan, and others, as well as two stories from the legendary pulp magazine Weird Tales (Seabury Quinn’s “The Phantom Farmhouse” and Arthur J. Burks’s “Bells of Oceana”). The volume contains an introduction by S. T. Joshi as well as notes on the individual stories, giving background on the authors as well as on Lovecraft’s appreciation of the tales and their possible influence on his work.

It looks like most of the selections were lifted from H.P. Lovecraft's
["Supernatural Horror in
Literature"](http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/essays/shil.aspx). The
second volume, [*The Dead Valley and
Others*](http://darkrenaissance.com/product/the-dead-valley-and-others-h-p-lovecrafts-favorite-horror-stories-vol-2-edited-by-s-t-joshi-coming-soon),
is not out yet but it looks like it should be coming soon. Overall, it looks
like a solid collection of stories for people who like early horror and weird
fiction.

###UPDATE (July 22, 2014)

I got my copy of *The Ghost of Fear and Others* in the mail today and it's
quite a fine looking book. I can't wait to read it. It arrived pretty quickly
after I ordered it so I'm very happy with Dark Renaissance. I'll try to write a
review after I read it.
