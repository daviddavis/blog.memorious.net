In honor of OS X Mavericks being released this past week, I thought I'd take a
chance to make a list of applications that I use and consider essential on OS
X. So here it is!

- iTerm2 - excellent Terminal replacement that lets you customize it to the
  fullest plus provides awesome features like splits.
- Caffeine - prevents your computer from sleeping. Handy for Netflix, etc.
- Wunderlist - a TODO list manager
- Evernote - for taking notes
- VLC - for watching mkv files
- Transmission - for downloading--uhhhh--linux distros
- Alfred 2 - my favorite Quicksilver-like workflow launcher
- AppCleaner - a tool for removing applications
- CheatSheet - shows you shortcuts when you hold the CMD button down
- CloudApp -  awesome app for sharing screenshots and files
- Cyberduck - great app for FTP, SFTP, S3, etc
- Dropbox or Google Drive - for syncing files
- Fluid - for building small apps out of webpages (grooveshark, etc)
- GitX - a solid app for viewing git history, diffs, etc
- Handbrake - app for converting videos to mp4 for watching on iOS and AppleTV
- LimeChat - an IRC client for when I am not using weechat
- Homebrew - software installer written in Ruby
- LittleSnitch - great for limiting outgoing/incoming connections
- PCKeyboardHack - for remapping the Capslock key to Escape
