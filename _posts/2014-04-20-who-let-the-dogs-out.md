title: "Who Let the Dogs Out?"
---

"Who Let the Dogs Out?" is a existential piece by the philosophers in the late
90's known as the Baha Men. In this metaphorical treatise, they ask the
rhetorical question: who let the dogs out? In other words, much like Hume's
[Problem of Induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_Induction),
they're asking: why does cause proceed effect?

Take for example the deeply profound statement they make in the first verse,
"Till them man they start they name callin/Then them girls respond to the
call." This strikes at the inexplicable origins of *a posteriori* knowledge.
One cannot help but ask, is the consistency of our world that produces
empirical evidence a perception of the human mind or is it an actual construct
of reality?
